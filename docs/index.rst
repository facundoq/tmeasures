üîé Visualizations
---------------------_

``tmeasures`` allows computing invariance, same-equivariance and other
transformational measures, and contains helpful functions to visualize
these. The following are some examples of the results you can obtain
with the library:

üî• Invariance heatmap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each column shows the invariance to rotation of a layer of a Neural
Network. Each row/block inside each column indicates the invariance of a
feature map or single neuron, depending on the layer.

üìâ Average Invariance vs layer, same model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plot the transformational and sample invariance to rotations of a simple
neural network trained on MNIST, with and without data augmentation. The
X axis indicates the layer, while the Y axis shows the average
invariance of the layer.

üìà Average invariance by layer, different models:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plot of the invariance to rotations of several well-known models trained
on CIFAR10. The number of layers of each model is streched on a
percentage scale, so that different models can be compared.

üíª PyTorch API
---------------

The following notebook contains a step-by-step to measure invariance to
rotations in a PyTorch neural network that was trained with the MNIST
dataset. You can execute it directly from google colab.

`Measuring invariance to rotations for a simple CNN on MNIST (google
colab) <https://colab.research.google.com/github/facundoq/transformational_measures/blob/master/docs/examples/Variance%20to%20rotations%20of%20a%20CNN%20trained%20on%20MNIST%20with%20PyTorch.ipynb>`__

Other examples with multiple measures and pretrained models can be found
in the `doc </doc>`__ folder of this repository.

üíª TensorFlow API
------------------

We are still developing the Tensorflow API.

üìã Examples
------------

You can find many uses of this library in the `repository with the
code <https://github.com/facundoq/transformational_measures_experiments>`__
for the article `Measuring (in)variances in Convolutional
Networks <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-27713-0_9>`__,
where this library was first presented. Also, in the code for the
experiments of the PhD Thesis `‚ÄúInvariance and Same-Equivariance
Measures for Convolutional Neural Networks‚Äù
(spanish) <https://doi.org/10.24215/16666038.20.e06>`__.
